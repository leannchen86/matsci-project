The related compound Pu(IO4)2 in the same family has a far lower GII of 0.262 and is explicitly formulated as an iodate/periodate. Does the catastrophic BVS failure here (GII = 7.29) arise entirely from a misassigned iodine oxidation state, and would reassigning I as +7 bring the GII in line with the family member's 0.262?"

With a compound class warning triggered and only single-method oxi assignment, the BVS parameters being used are calibrated for oxide environments. In a sulfur-dominated structure, the oxygen coordination environment is fundamentally different from a typical oxide. Should BVS even be computed for a material where O is a minority anion surrounded by S, and does the Pauling Rule 2 'perfect' score (1.0 on only 3 checked polyhedra) reflect that only the Al-centered polyhedra were analyzable while the S sublattice was ignored?"

The GII also varies dramatically: Tb2CO at 0.766, Tb5C2O3 at 0.397, and Tb4C2O at 0.945. All Tb sites in Tb4C2O are underbonded (BVS 1.84-2.04 vs. expected 3+). These are carbide-oxides (rare earth oxycarbides), where carbon likely exists as C4- rather than the C4+ assumed by the oxi_state_guesses method. Reassigning carbon as carbide (C4-) in Tb4C2O would give 4(3+) + 2(4-) + 1(2-) = +2, which matches the observed +2 residual -- confirming the charge imbalance is an artifact of wrong C oxidation state assignment, not a structural problem."

Its family member Pd5Pb3O14 has an even worse GII of 1.298. The systematic underbonding of Pd suggests the expected Pd4+ may be wrong -- Pd2+ is far more common in oxide chemistry (PdO is the stable binary). If Pd is actually 2+ and Pb is 2+ (its most common state), then PdPb3O7 would need re-evaluation: Pd(2+) + 3Pb(2+) + 7O(2-) = -6, far from neutral. The charge residual of -2.0 with the current assignment already signals trouble. This material may represent a case where neither common oxidation state combination achieves charge balance, questioning whether this composition is chemically viable."

The Br BVS is 0.845 against expected -1 (deviation 1.845 -- the worst single-site deviation in this entire batch), meaning the model sees Br receiving positive bonding instead of being anionic. The related Cr(BrO3)3 has GII 0.808 with zero charge. This suggests GNoME may have predicted a structure with Br in a covalent/bromate-like environment (Br5+) but the oxi state assignment defaulted to Br(-1). Reassigning Br as Br5+ would likely resolve the charge imbalance and the anomalous BVS."

Yet its Ba-Os-O family contains members with excellent validation: Ba2(OsO3)3 at GII 0.045 and Ba4Os6O19 at GII 0.113. The contrast is extreme -- the same chemical system produces both near-perfect and catastrophically failing structures. With oxidation states from only single-method assignment, the Os oxidation state in Ba3OsO7 may be incorrect: the formula requires Os8+ for neutrality, which is at the extreme limit of osmium chemistry and may explain the universal Pauling violations."

This is an unusual case where every phosphorus is consistently overbonded rather than underbonded. With As(III) and P(V) both confirmed by two agreeing methods, the structure appears chemically sound by all Tier 1 metrics. The systematic P overbonding suggests the P-O bonds are compressed relative to typical metaphosphate chains. Could this novel triclinic (P-1) structure represent a high-pressure-like phase with anomalously short P-O distances?"

Bi4+ is extremely rare -- bismuth strongly prefers +3 or +5. If the two high-BVS sites are actually Bi5+ (deviation drops to 0.8%) and the low-BVS site is Bi3+ (deviation becomes 0.9%), the structure would contain mixed-valence Bi3+/Bi5+ with near-perfect local bonding. This would make Cd9Bi7O24 a charge-disproportionated bismuthate, similar to BaBiO3 -- a class of materials with potential superconducting properties. Does reclassifying Bi as mixed +3/+5 resolve all validation anomalies simultaneously?"

With no K5LaO4 family members in the dataset (unlike the K-Sc-O system which shows two members), this isolated prediction raises a question: is the K5MO4 framework so dominated by the K-O sublattice that the central M3+ ion is largely a spectator, and if so, could this tolerance be exploited for rare-earth-agnostic synthesis?"

If U6+ is the correct assignment throughout this Cs-U-O family, does the fact that CsU3O9 adopts the hexagonal SG 194 (P6_3/mmc) suggest a uranyl-type layered structure where Cs+ occupies interlayer sites, and would U6+ assignment bring the charge closer to neutrality (+1+18-18 = +1, still off)?"

This is far worse than the dataset median GII of ~0.43 v.u. With a near-zero bandgap of 0.001 eV, the compound appears metallic. Given that Eu commonly adopts both +2 and +3 oxidation states and the assigned state is Eu2+, could the extreme 36.2% underbonding instead indicate that Eu is actually in the +3 state in this structure, which would break charge neutrality (Eu3+: 3*3 + 4*3 - 9*2 = 3 excess) but dramatically improve the BVS match?"

Its computationally known family member La(CoO2)3 achieves GII 0.246 with zero charge residual, suggesting the 3:1 Co:La ratio is the stability sweet spot. The 8:1 ratio implies La3+ must stabilize eight CoO2 layers, yet its BVS of 1.995 is closer to La2+ than La3+. Does this extreme stoichiometry represent a GNoME extrapolation artifact where the neural network extended a stable La-Co-O motif beyond the geometric limit of lanthanum's coordination capacity?"

All three worst-BVS sites are phosphorus, overbonded at 5.964-6.032 vs expected +5 (19.3-20.6% deviation). Since P5+ exclusively forms PO4 tetrahedra in known phosphates with BVS close to 5.0, a systematic 20% overbonding across all P sites suggests either compressed P-O bonds or excess coordination. With 67% experimental precedent for SG 14 (P2_1/c) yet prediction of SG 8 (Cm), could the wrong symmetry assignment have distorted the PO4 tetrahedra, artificially inflating the P BVS values?"

This ~30% Mn underbonding is consistent across all symmetry-equivalent Mn sites, suggesting a systematic rather than local effect. The experimental space group precedent is spread across SG 135, 150, and 152 (20% each), but GNoME predicts SG 165 (P-3c1). Could the predicted trigonal structure create Mn-O octahedra that are systematically too large, and would the Mn2+ ions be better accommodated in the SG 150 or 152 structures that are experimentally observed for Mn antimonates?"

Meanwhile U at 4.584 v.u. vs expected 5+ (dev 0.083) is nearly ideal. The K-U-O family shows that the novel KU3O9 has GII 0.498 with charge failure, while K6UO6 achieves neutrality with GII 0.319. Does the extreme K underbonding in K3UO4 reflect the well-known tendency of large alkali cations to rattle in oversized oxide cavities, and could this predict high K-ion conductivity in this phase?"

The oxi methods disagree (both_disagree), confirming the ambiguity. Family member EuSb11O26 has GII 1.01 with -5.0 charge residual, while Eu6SbO12 could not even compute GII. If Eu is reassigned from 2+ to 3+, the charge balance shifts from 0.0 to +1.0 per formula unit -- does this compound reveal a systematic failure mode where oxi guessers pick Eu2+ to force charge neutrality but the actual bonding environment screams Eu3+?"
